		<p>Song graduated in 2015 in Master of Financial Mathematics with a concentration in computer science, he has worked on many school related heavy programming projects in Matlab, Java, C#, but among all, his main interest has come to emerge as a mobile developer in late 2013 where he released a few Android apps that gathered more than 100,000 downloads. He has been working mainly in native Android apps and iOS apps in swift ever since.

			Other than sitting in front of the computer, I enjoy going many outdoor activities. I like the thrill of dribbling a soccer ball. I like picking some melody on the guitar:)  Life is full of surprises and joy isn't it.
