		<p>My name is Song, I am a graduate student here at the University of Minnesota. I spend a lot of time digging the technology such as Android and the Web. It is always exciting to create something new and fun.

			Other than sitting in front of the computer, I enjoy going many outdoor activities. I like the thrill of dribbling a soccer ball. I like picking some melody on the guitar:)  Life is full of surprises and joy isn't it.
